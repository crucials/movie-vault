# MovieVault

:movie_camera: Modern movie search app with smooth animations, filters and custom reactivity

[View the website :eyes:](https://crucials.github.io/movie-vault)

‚ùó _**20.07.23**_ - imdb-api.com free tier has been removed (so unexpected!!) so now this app uses their sample JSON data (_~240 movies_)

:hammer: Website was built with HTML, SCSS, TypeScript and Vite (as bundler)
